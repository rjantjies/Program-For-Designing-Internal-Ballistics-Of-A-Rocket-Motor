A thrust/time profile and other relevant independent performance parameters are supplied to the program in order for it to perform an optimization study to obtain the optimum set of grain and motor design parameters for grain configuration and internal ballistic design of a boost/sustain motor. Other output data generated is the required burn surface area/web burnt profile, the total impulse, the required sustainer length and port diameter and the required booster burning perimeter/web burnt profile. The burning perimeter as a function of the distance burnt will then be an input to the Config program, which will calculate and plot the appropriate star configuration for the booster.
